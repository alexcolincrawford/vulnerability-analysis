# Vulnerability Management Project with Tenable Nessus

## Objective
Implemented a comprehensive vulnerability management project leveraging Tenable Nessus and Metasploitable within a simulated environment. The project focused on identifying, prioritizing, and mitigating security vulnerabilities to strengthen network security posture.

### Skills Gained
- Proficiency in vulnerability scanning and assessment using Tenable Nessus.
- Experience with vulnerability prioritization based on severity and impact.
- Ability to interpret and analyze vulnerability scan reports to inform remediation strategies.
- Hands-on implementation of security measures through continuous vulnerability monitoring.
- Familiarity with virtualization technologies (VMware) for setting up target environments.

### Tools Used
- Nessus for vulnerability scanning and assessment.
- Metasploitable as a target environment to showcase vulnerabilities and demonstrate exploit scenarios
- VMware Workstation for managing the virtualized environments.
- Linux (Ubuntu) as the host operating system, but another host OS can be used.

## Steps
### Setting Up Metasploitable
1. Download Metasploitable @ https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/
2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file

3. Import into virtualization software
- As this project uses VMware Workstation, the .VMX can simply be imported.

4. Power on the box and login.
- Note: msfadmin is provided for both username and password.

5. Acquire IP address, using `ip a`, to ensure both devices can communicate
- By acquiring the IP address, it will enable us to scan the box for vulnerabilities using nessus later.

6. Finally, going back to our host machine, where Nessus will be setup, we should ensure the connectivity between the two machines

### Setting Up Tenable Nessus

1. Downloading the Tenable Nessus package file
- This is can be done @ https://docs.tenable.com/nessus/Content/InstallNessusLinux.htm#Download-the-Tenable-Nessus-package-file.

2. Verify The Hashes Match For Integrity
  - To ensure integrity, we should compute a hash and compare, as shown below.

4. Installing the Tenable Nessus package file
- Next, the package file can be installed, as shown below.

5. Starting The Service & Accessing Nessus Dashboard
- First the `nessusd.service` must be started, then, by going to typing in localhost and port 8834, we can get into the Nessus Dashboard

6. Register an account to Nessus Essentials
- Select Nessus Essentials, the free version, and create an account.

### Scanning The Metasploitable Machine via Nessus
- Note: There are many ways to configure a scan; this project shows one of the many configurations.
1. Select _Basic Network Scan_

2. Configuring Settings
- Make sure to include the IP address of the metasploitable machine in targets, as demonstrated below.

- Instead of most common ports, instead scan all ports.

3. Start Scan
- Save the configuration, start it, as shown, then wait for the results...

### Interpreting Scan Results
- A risk-based approach has been employed as means to priorize the remediation of vulnerabilities.

- By examining the report generated by nessus, the vulnerabilities are detailed using CVSS-based severity.
