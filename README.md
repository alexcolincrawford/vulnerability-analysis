# Vulnerability Management with Tenable Nessus

## Objective
The Vulnerability Management project with Nessus aims to establish effective vulnerability assessment and remediation practices within a simulated environment. The primary focus is on utilizing Tenable Nessus to identify, prioritize, and mitigate security vulnerabilities across a network infrastructure. This project will enhance understanding of vulnerability management processes and their critical role in maintaining a secure network environment

### Skills Learned

- Proficiency in vulnerability scanning and assessment using Tenable Nessus.
- Understanding of vulnerability prioritization based on severity and impact.
- Ability to interpret and analyze vulnerability scan reports.
- Implementation of remediation strategies to address identified vulnerabilities.
- Development of proactive security measures through continuous vulnerability monitoring.

### Tools Used
- Nessus for vulnerability scanning and assessment.
- Metasploitable as a target environment to showcase vulnerabilities and demonstrate exploit scenarios

## Steps
**Setting Up Metasploitable**
1. Download Metasploitable @ https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/
2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file

4. Power on the box and login.
- Note: msfadmin is provided for both username and password.

5. Acquire IP address, using `ip a`, to ensure both devices can communicate
- By acquiring the IP address, it will enable us to scan the box for vulnerabilities using nessus later.
