# Vulnerability Management with Tenable Nessus

## Objective
The Vulnerability Management project with Nessus aims to establish effective vulnerability assessment and remediation practices within a simulated environment. The primary focus is on utilizing Tenable Nessus to identify, prioritize, and mitigate security vulnerabilities across a network infrastructure. This project will enhance understanding of vulnerability management processes and their critical role in maintaining a secure network environment

### Skills Learned

- Proficiency in vulnerability scanning and assessment using Tenable Nessus.
- Understanding of vulnerability prioritization based on severity and impact.
- Ability to interpret and analyze vulnerability scan reports.
- Implementation of remediation strategies to address identified vulnerabilities.
- Development of proactive security measures through continuous vulnerability monitoring.

### Tools Used
- Nessus for vulnerability scanning and assessment.
- Metasploitable as a target environment to showcase vulnerabilities and demonstrate exploit scenarios

## Steps
**Setting Up Metasploitable**
1. Download Metasploitable @ https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/
2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file

4. Power on the box and login.
- Note: msfadmin is provided for both username and password.

5. Acquire IP address, using `ip a`, to ensure both devices can communicate
- By acquiring the IP address, it will enable us to scan the box for vulnerabilities using nessus later.

6. Finally, going back to our host machine, where Nessus will be setup, we should ensure the connectivity between the two machines
